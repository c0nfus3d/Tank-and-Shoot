## Tank and Shoot 

**Tank and Shoot** is a tank shooting game in ImpactJS. 

[Play Tank and Shoot - **Full Version**](http://theyconfuse.me/game/tank_shoot) 



----------
The code available here is for the basic game play, not the exact game available to play above.

You only get one included level and no special power ups!

This "Lite Version" is being released so you can play around with the idea on your own, not to have a full duplicate of the available game.
